# Name Generation System & GameManager Fix

## ✅ **Issues Fixed:**

### **1. GameManager Instance Error**
- **Problem**: GameManager instance wasn't being initialized when starting the game
- **Solution**: 
  - Added static `SelectedRace` property to GameManager
  - Updated MainMenu to store selected race before scene transition
  - Modified GameManager to auto-start game when loaded with a selected race

### **2. Added Comprehensive Name Generation**
- **New System**: Complete name generation for all races and genders
- **Features**:
  - Race-specific name pools (Human, Goblin, Spider, Demon, Vampire)
  - Gender-appropriate names (Male/Female variants)
  - Culturally appropriate surnames for each race
  - Used throughout the game for players and NPCs

## 🆕 **New Features Added:**

### **📛 Name Generator (`NameGenerator.cs`)**
- **Extensive name databases** for all races
- **Gender-specific names** with appropriate cultural themes
- **Race-appropriate surnames** (e.g., Goblins get "Boneshard", Vampires get "Dracul")
- **Examples by race**:
  - **Human**: "Alexander Ashford", "Catherine Moonwhisper"
  - **Goblin**: "Grax Boneshard", "Zixa Mudcrawler"  
  - **Spider**: "Arachnis the Silken", "Venomweave the Deadly"
  - **Demon**: "Baal the Corruptor", "Lilith Soulrender"
  - **Vampire**: "Vlad Dracul", "Carmilla Bloodthorne"

### **👤 Player Identity System**
- **Generated player names** based on race and gender
- **Random gender assignment** or can be specified
- **Full identity tracking**: Name, Gender, Race displayed in UI
- **Examples**: "Grex Stinkfist (Male Goblin)", "Luna Fairwind (Female Human)"

### **🎮 Enhanced HUD (`HUDManager.cs`)**
- **Real-time player stats** including name, race, gender
- **Dynamic world information** with population tracking
- **Live event log** showing world events as they happen
- **Population breakdown** by race
- **World destruction indicator** when population reaches zero

### **🌍 World Population Names**
- **All NPCs get proper names** using the name generation system
- **Children inherit naming patterns** from their racial background
