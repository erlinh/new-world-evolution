# Build Fixes Applied

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Property Accessor Issues
**Problem:** `CurrentEvolution` and `CurrentProfession` properties in `PlayerController` had private setters, but other classes needed to modify them.

**Solution:** Changed property declarations from:
```csharp
public string CurrentEvolution { get; private set; }
public string CurrentProfession { get; private set; }
```

To:
```csharp
public string CurrentEvolution { get; set; }
public string CurrentProfession { get; set; }
```

### 2. Variable Name Conflicts
**Problem:** Local variables named `skillManager` conflicted with method parameters in the same scope.

**Files affected:**
- `Scripts/Player/Evolution/EvolutionManager.cs` (line 183)
- `Scripts/Player/Profession/ProfessionManager.cs` (line 177)

**Solution:** Renamed local variables to avoid conflicts:
- In `EvolutionManager.cs`: Renamed `skillManager` to `skillMgr` in the `skill_level` case
- In `ProfessionManager.cs`: Renamed `skillManager` to `skillMgr` in the `skill_level` case
- In `AttemptEvolution()` method: Renamed `skillManager` to `evolutionSkillManager`
- In `ChangeProfession()` method: Renamed `skillManager` to `professionSkillManager`

## Build Status
