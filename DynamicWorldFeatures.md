# Dynamic World Features - Now Implemented!

## ‚úÖ **Game is Now Runnable!**
The project now builds successfully and includes basic scene files that make it playable in Godot.

## üåç **Dynamic World Systems Added**

### **1. World Simulation Engine** (`WorldSimulation.cs`)
- **Real-time world progression** with configurable time scales
- **Day/night cycles** and yearly progression
- **Population dynamics** with births, deaths, aging
- **Dynamic events** (raids, plagues, festivals, discoveries)
- **Settlement growth and decay**
- **Trade route establishment**
- **World destruction mechanics** (kill everyone = end world)

### **2. NPC Lifecycle System** (`NPCData.cs`)
**Complete life simulation including:**
- ‚úÖ **Birth and genetics** - Children inherit stats and traits from parents
- ‚úÖ **Aging and death** - NPCs age naturally and die of old age or events
- ‚úÖ **Marriage system** - NPCs find partners within their race and settlement
- ‚úÖ **Family trees** - Track parents, children, and relationships
- ‚úÖ **Evolution** - Non-human NPCs can evolve over time
- ‚úÖ **Professions** - NPCs have jobs that affect their communities
- ‚úÖ **Personality traits** - Inherited and developed characteristics

### **3. Settlement Dynamics**
**Living, breathing communities:**
- ‚úÖ **Population tracking** - Real-time population changes
- ‚úÖ **Building construction** - Settlements grow and add new buildings
- ‚úÖ **Economic prosperity** - Prosperity affects growth and survival
- ‚úÖ **Defense systems** - Protection from raids and disasters
- ‚úÖ **Ghost towns** - Settlements can become abandoned if everyone dies
- ‚úÖ **Trade networks** - Dynamic trade route establishment

### **4. Economy System** (`EconomySystem.cs`)
**Dynamic market simulation:**
- ‚úÖ **Supply and demand pricing** - Prices fluctuate based on availability
- ‚úÖ **Race-specific shops** - Different races have different economic focuses
- ‚úÖ **Shop closure** - Economic hardship can close businesses
- ‚úÖ **Inventory management** - Shops restock and manage their goods
- ‚úÖ **Market events** - Economic booms and busts

### **5. Generational Progression**
**Multi-generational gameplay:**
- ‚úÖ **Time passage** - Configurable day/year cycles
- ‚úÖ **Generational changes** - Families span multiple generations
- ‚úÖ **Evolution over time** - Species evolve across generations
- ‚úÖ **Historical events** - Track major world events over time
- ‚úÖ **Bloodline tracking** - Family trees and inheritance

## üéÆ **Gameplay Features**

### **World Destruction Mechanics**
- **Total genocide possible** - You can literally kill everyone
- **Population tracking** - Watch the world population in real-time
- **Settlement extinction** - Settlements become ghost towns
- **Economic collapse** - Markets crash as populations decline
- **World end condition** - Game tracks if the world is completely destroyed

### **Dynamic NPCs**
- **Evolution paths** - Goblins become Hobgoblins, then Chiefs
- **Marriage and families** - NPCs form relationships and have children
- **Profession changes** - NPCs can change careers over time
- **Personality inheritance** - Children inherit traits from parents
- **Death and birth events** - Real-time population changes

### **Living Economy**
- **Price fluctuations** - Market prices change based on supply/demand
- **Regional differences** - Different settlements have different economies
- **Economic events** - Market crashes, trade booms, resource discoveries
- **Shop dynamics** - Shops open, close, and change ownership

### **Random Events**
- **Raids** - Settlements can be attacked, causing casualties
- **Plagues** - Diseases can sweep through populations
- **Festivals** - Celebrations boost settlement prosperity
- **Discoveries** - Resource finds improve settlement wealth
- **Heroes** - Legendary figures emerge and affect the world

## üìä **Real-time Tracking**

### **Population Statistics**
```csharp
// Track total world population
int totalPopulation = WorldSimulation.Instance.GetTotalPopulation();

// Population by race
var racePopulations = WorldSimulation.Instance.GetPopulationByRace();

// Check if world is destroyed
bool isDestroyed = WorldSimulation.Instance.IsWorldDestroyed();
```

### **Settlement Monitoring**
```csharp
// Get NPCs in a settlement
var villagers = WorldSimulation.Instance.GetNPCsInSettlement("New Haven");

// Track settlement prosperity
var settlement = WorldSimulation.Instance.AllSettlements["New Haven"];
int prosperity = settlement.Prosperity;
```

### **Economic Data**
```csharp
// Current market prices
float breadPrice = EconomySystem.Instance.GetCurrentPrice("Bread");

// Active shops
var shops = EconomySystem.Instance.GetShopsInSettlement("New Haven");
```

## üéØ **Impact on Gameplay**

### **Player Actions Have Consequences**
- **Kill NPCs** ‚Üí Families mourn, settlements decline
- **Destroy settlements** ‚Üí Trade routes collapse, economy suffers
- **Cause chaos** ‚Üí World becomes increasingly unstable
- **Eliminate races** ‚Üí Lose entire branches of evolution trees

### **World Reacts to Player**
- **Population growth** affects available quests and shops
- **Economic changes** impact item prices and availability
- **Settlement prosperity** affects what services are available
- **World events** create new opportunities and challenges

### **Long-term Progression**
- **Generational play** - Watch families grow and evolve over time
- **Historical impact** - Your actions become part of world history
- **Economic legacy** - Your choices affect long-term market trends
- **Population consequences** - Every death matters to the world

## üéÆ **How to Experience These Features**

1. **Start the game** - Load into the main menu and create a character
2. **Explore settlements** - Visit different racial communities
3. **Track world info** - Watch the population and day counters
4. **Listen for events** - World events are announced in real-time
5. **Revisit locations** - See how settlements change over time
6. **Cause mayhem** - Test the world destruction mechanics!

## üîß **Technical Implementation**

- **Event-driven architecture** - Efficient real-time simulation
- **Configurable time scales** - Adjust simulation speed
- **Save-compatible** - All world state can be saved/loaded
- **Performance optimized** - Handles large populations efficiently
- **Modular design** - Easy to extend with new features

The game now truly features a **living, breathing world** that evolves and changes based on your actions. Every NPC matters, every settlement can thrive or die, and you have the power to shape or destroy entire civilizations!
